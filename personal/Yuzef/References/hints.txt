Naming files conventions:
Aim for readability
Keep some form of consistency


Types of naming 
-> Snake_case
	Basic_boring_soulless_choice
-> CamelCase
	ASentenceOutOfThatManyWordsSpelledLikeThisIsJustNotReadable
-> Spaces -- A bad idea
	Harder to work with the files and directories in the command line
-> kebab-case That is the one
	looks-the-most-fancy-and-about-as-readable-as-spaces-method


Probably use kebab-case for naming files and packages, and whatever else you are developing or saving
and use snake_case for for variables and functions in most languages
except for Haskell, where camelCase is very popular, and seems pretty conventional

Leave the spaces to human languages


AVOID SPECIAL CHARACTERS


Use dates when creating an important file
